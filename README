jpg2bts
-------

Converts jpg to bts
the fileformat used by Prof. Dr. Richter from Wiesbaden for the DBV Application
DBV = Digitale Bild Verarbeitung

this tool automatically scales and converts your jpg files
tested with the DBV app 2009

I assumed .bts stood for bytestream
so it converts every pixel to grayscale between 0 (black) and 255(white)
there was some trial&error on how the bytes need to be arranged but it worked

have fun and always give credit!

credits for different parts are in the source
